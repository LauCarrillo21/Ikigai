                <em> â€˜Ikiâ€™ </em> in Japanese means â€˜life,â€™ and <em> â€˜gaiâ€™ </em> describes value or worth. <strong>  Your ikigai is your life purpose or your bliss. </strong>
                <br />
                Itâ€™s what brings you joy and inspires you to get out of bed every day.

            <h4>  Four Key Components of Ikigai</h4>
            <p> 
                Your ikigai resides at the intersection of multiple factors in your life. 
                <br />
                These four components are essential to the Japanese concept of ikigai:
                <br />
                1. Mission: What does the world need?,Ask yourself how you can contribute to making the world a better place.
                <br />
                2. Passion: What do you love? Define what you love to do the most and keep doing it for the rest of your life.
                <br />
                3. Profession: What can you be paid for? Look for a career that serves the world, sparks your own interest, and brings you joy.
                <br />
                4. Talent: What talents do you possess?  Spending each day doing something you love, that comes easily to you.

                Create four overlapping circles (mission, passion, profession, and talent) and start to fill them with words.
                This sort of ikigai diagram or template enables you to start defining your sense of purpose in a very hands-on way. 
                As you fill in each circle, try to keep an eye out for the commonalities between themâ€”and especially the similarities that fit right in the center of the diagram. This is the sweet spot that will help you clearly define your ikigai.
